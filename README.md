# Student Management System (ASMDSA)

## 📝 Overview

This repository contains the source code for a **Student Management System**, developed as an assignment for the **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** course. The project aims to apply fundamental data structures and algorithms to manage student records efficiently.

## 🚀 Features

The **StudentManager** module provides the following functionalities:

* **Add Student:** Input details for new students.
* **Update Student:** Modify information of existing students.
* **Delete Student:** Remove a student record from the system.
* **Search:** Find students by ID or Name.
* **Sort:** Sort the student list by Marks or ID (using sorting algorithms).
* **Display:** Show the full list of students.

## 🛠️ Project Structure

The project consists of the following core files:

* `Main`: The entry point of the application (handles the menu and user interaction).
* `Student`: Defines the properties of a Student object (ID, Name, Marks, etc.).
* `StudentManager`: Contains the data structures and logic to manage the list of students (CRUD operations).
